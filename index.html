# Ideate

???

Let's generate radical design alternatives.

---

class: center, middle

# Go wide

???

Think of this as flaring out rather than focusing in.

---

class: center, middle

# Wide solution space

???

We want a large quantity and diversity of ideas.

---

class: center, middle

# Generating ideas

???

We are generating ideas and we are *not* evaluating them at this time.

---

# Three Things

???

Let's start by getting our brain going, our energy up. (Explain and do Three Things for 5-10 minutes.)

---

# "Understand creative innovators and how they get things done."

???

Here's our challenge. It's open to suggestions for improvement. But if it's OK, let's use it...

# Point Of View

???

Spend five minutes trying to come up with a point of view you want to explore. Then spend five minutes picking one or three.

* Format: Such and such a person, doing such and such, needs to such and such, because such and such.

# How Might We...

???

We want 5-10 of these. Let's spend 10 minutes on this.

Create small, actionable questions.

* Amp up the good.
* Remove the bad
* Explore the opposite
* Question an assumption
* Go after adjectives
* ID unexpected resources
* Create an analogy from need or context
* Play against the challenge
* Change a status quo
* Break POV into pieces

# Brainstorm Rules

1. One Conversation at a Time
2. Encourage Wild Ideas
3. Go For Quantity
4. Be Visual
5. Headline!
6. Stay on Topic
7. Build on the Ideas of Others
8. Defer Judgement&mdash;**No** Blocking
9. Active posture (stand, sit upright, get close together)

???

In a nutshell, generate ideas, do not evaluate ideas (yet).

Write your idea on a post-it, share it verbally with everyone, and put it on the whiteboard.

Let's pick a HWM and brainstorm on it for 15 minutes. Maybe pick another one and brainstorm on it for 15 minutes if energy is high.

# Selection Rules

1. Preserve the breadth of solutions
2. Don't just settle for the safe choice
3. Don't narrow too fast
4. Don't immediately worry about feasibility. An idea that is implausible may have an aspect within that is useful and meaningful.
5. Hang on to the ideas about which the group is excited, amused, or intrigued

???

We're going to need to prototype these things. So let's divide the ideas into three possible types of prototypes: physical, digital, and experiential. Then, we all get three chips to vote on the ideas that we are attracted to. Highest vote-getter in each categroy will go forward. Or maybe two highest. Or something else. This situation is fluid. Until the end of the meeting.
